# Advent of Code 2020

Welcome to my implementations of the puzzles in [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

My approach is to implement this in "as-clean-code-as-possible" manner :-). For this I have also Unit Tests and I implement in ABAP OO.

For a better overview I put the code in ABAP reports, there I can put all the classes locally and its less messy in the repo.
